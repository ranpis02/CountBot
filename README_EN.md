---

## v0.7.0 Highlights

### 1. Issue fixes and stability improvements

This release starts with user feedback. It addresses multiple issue reports and a batch of known bugs across tool calls, configuration flows, skill integration, and general runtime behavior.

### 2. Better frontend usability

The frontend is refined around high-frequency paths so common operations in skills, settings, and tools feel more direct and easier to understand.

### 3. Leaner tool calling

The tool execution pipeline and context assembly are reorganized to reduce overhead without shrinking capability coverage. Compared with the previous version, overall tool-call token usage can be reduced by about 70%.

### 4. Thinking control switch

A new thinking control switch lets you adjust reasoning intensity by scenario, which improves perceived response speed in many everyday tasks.

### 5. `find-skills` with SkillsHub

`find-skills` is now integrated with Tencent Cloud SkillsHub, so users can search, install, enable, disable, and remove skills directly through conversation.

### 6. `ima-knowledge-base` and `ima-notes`

Two new skills bring IMA integration into the workflow:

- `ima-knowledge-base`: search knowledge bases, inspect hits, browse items, upload files, and import web pages
- `ima-notes`: search notes, read notes, create notes, and append content

This expands CountBot from "chat and call tools" into "chat and manage knowledge assets" more naturally.

---

## What is CountBot?

CountBot is a lightweight, extensible AI Agent framework optimized for Chinese users and domestic LLMs. With only ~21,000 lines of Python, it delivers production-grade intelligent assistant infrastructure featuring:

- Smart Memory — Auto-summarizes conversations, never forgets important info
- Proactive Greeting — Like a real assistant, reaches out when you're idle
- Zero-Config Security — Frictionless local access, auto-protected remote access
- Multi-Channel Unified — One codebase serving Web, Lark, DingTalk, QQ, Telegram, WeChat
- Personalization — 12 personality presets + custom nicknames and location
- Message Queue — Priority scheduling, deduplication, dead-letter handling
- Domestic LLM Optimized — Deep support for Zhipu, Qwen, Kimi, MiniMax, DeepSeek, etc.

Core philosophy: Make AI Agents into digital companions with memory, emotion, initiative, and collaboration.

CountBot was born from natural language. Our vision is not to make more people learn configuration and programming before they can use AI, but to let ordinary users directly interact with AI through natural language to retrieve information, generate content, break down tasks, call tools, orchestrate workflows, and eventually build their own personal assistants, team collaboration flows, and automation systems.

---

## Why CountBot?

CountBot was born from natural language, and we believe software will continue moving back toward natural language as its most universal interface.

CountBot is not trying to be just another "chat with AI" shell. It aims to be open infrastructure that lets ordinary users use natural language to drive AI, organize tools, connect channels, and land real-world tasks.

### Top 10 Highlights

| Highlight | Description | Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Chinese-Friendly | 21K lines with full Chinese comments, comprehensive docs, deep domestic LLM integration | Low learning curve |
| Dual Deployment | B/S browser + C/S desktop client, one codebase | Fits personal & team use |
| Domestic Ecosystem | 10 built-in skill plugins: search, maps, email, file transfer, web publishing, etc. | Works out of the box |
| GUI Configuration | Full web-based management, zero config file editing | Fewer config errors |
| Deep Personalization | 12 personality system + custom nicknames & location | Warm interaction |
| High Performance | Smart context compression, significantly reduced token usage | Cost-effective |
| Progressive Security | Local access fully open, remote access auto-protected | Security meets convenience |
| Lightweight | 21K lines vs 50K–400K in other frameworks, modular design | Easy to read & extend |
| Smart Memory | Auto-summarize, keyword search, never forget | Long-term companion |
| Message Queue | 4-level priority, deduplication, dead-letter handling | Production-grade reliability |

---

CountBot combines built-in tools and skill plugins to handle a variety of daily tasks:

### Information Retrieval & Search

"Search for today's AI news"
- Uses Baidu Search skill to fetch and summarize the latest information

"Find Western restaurants in Dongguan, I plan to leave at 6 PM"
- Calls Amap (Gaode) skill to search restaurants and plan routes

"What's the weather like today?"
- Queries the weather skill for real-time and forecast data

### Email & File Management

- Connects to QQ/163 mailbox via email skill, auto-checks new mail

"Compress the images on my desktop and send them to my email"
- Uses file tools to package files, sends via email skill

### Image Processing & Creation

"Generate a picture of a cat celebrating New Year and send it to me"
- Calls image generation skill for AI art, delivers via channel

"Take a screenshot of my computer and send it to me"
- Uses screenshot tool to capture screen, sends via Lark/DingTalk

"What's in this image?"
- Image analysis skill identifies content with detailed descriptions

### Web Design & Publishing

"Design a personal resume webpage and publish it online"
- Uses web design skill to generate HTML, auto-deploys to Cloudflare Pages

- Browser automation skill handles complex web operation workflows

### Scheduled Tasks

"Check the weather for me every morning at 8 AM"
- Sets up a Cron task that auto-executes and pushes results

### Multi-Channel Collaboration

CountBot runs simultaneously on Web, Lark, DingTalk, QQ, and more. All channels share the same smart memory system — no matter where you chat, the AI remembers your preferences and history.

---

## Core Features

### Smart Memory System

CountBot's memory system includes:

- **Auto Conversation Summary** — LLM decides when to summarize, extracting key information
- **Rolling Context Compression** — Auto-compresses when conversation exceeds window, no info lost
- **Keyword Search** — Fast retrieval of historical memories by keyword
- **Line-Based Storage** — Simple, reliable file storage, easy to backup and migrate

```python
# Memory system works automatically
User: "My name is John, I live in Beijing"
AI: "Got it, I'll remember that"

# Days later...
User: "Where do I live again?"
AI: "You live in Beijing"  # Auto-retrieved from memory
```

### Heartbeat Proactive Greeting

CountBot has **proactive care capabilities**:

- **Smart Idle Detection** — Monitors user's last active time
- **Do Not Disturb** — Supports DND time windows (e.g., 22:00–08:00 Beijing time)
- **Daily Limit** — Prevents over-disturbance (default: max 2 per day)
- **Natural Randomness** — Not mechanical timed greetings, but natural care

```python
# User inactive for 4 hours, within active hours
AI: "Long time no see! What have you been up to? Need any help?"
```

### Zero-Config Security Model

An innovative **progressive security** design:

- **Local Access (127.0.0.1)** → Zero friction, direct use
- **Remote Access (192.168.x.x)** → Guided password setup on first visit
- **Password Requirements** → Min 8 chars, upper/lowercase + digits
- **Session Management** → 24-hour validity

```bash
# Local use — no configuration needed
http://localhost:8000  ✅ Direct access

# Remote use — auto-protected
http://192.168.1.100:8000  🔐 First-time password setup
```

### Personalization

In the Settings page under "User Management", you can configure:

12 Personality Presets

CountBot offers 12 distinct personality settings: Hot-Tempered Bro, Roast Master, Gentle Sister, Straight Shooter, Sharp-Tongued Boss, Chatterbox, Philosopher, Soft & Cute Assistant, Comedian, Energetic, Chuunibyou, Zen Master. You can also fully customize the personality description to match your usage habits.

Custom Nicknames & Location

- AI Name — Give your assistant a name (default: CountBot)
- User Nickname — How the AI addresses you
- User Location — Your location info (e.g., Dongguan), used for weather, maps, trip planning

### Precision On-Demand Cron Scheduler

Not polling, not a simple timer, but a **smart scheduling system**:

- **Precision Wake** — Calculates next task time, accurate to the second
- **Concurrency Control** — Semaphore-based max concurrency
- **Timeout Protection** — Max execution time per task (default: 300s)
- **Independent Sessions** — Each task uses its own database session
- **SQLite Lock Retry** — Auto-handles concurrent write conflicts

```python
# Not polling every second, but precisely calculating next wake time
next_wake = min([job.next_run for job in enabled_jobs])
await asyncio.sleep((next_wake - now).total_seconds())
```
